            While working at companies like Box, Airbnb, ServiceNow we saw that
            over 40% of the spend is unattended and non-negotiated. A typical
            company has more than 200+ apps, Finance, IT teams are struggling to
            get visibility on the spend, optimize the spend and streamline the
            buying and renewal process. They donâ€™t have the bandwidth nor the,
            tools, data, or expert help to do it on their own. Unmanaged
            environments such as these, tend to overspend by over 30% and have
            chaotic procurement processes. We are here to help companies save
            both time and money !!
